        <dt>Angkor Wat</dt>
        <dd>With its wide moat and drip sand castle-like towers, Angkor Wat is one of the most scenic World Heritage sites and recognizable religious structures. King Suryavarman II, ruler of Southeast Asiaâ€™s former Khmer Empire, directed the construction during the 12th century.</dd>

        <dt>Paris</dt>
        <dd>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. </dd>

        <dt>Bali</dt>
        <dd>Bali is a living postcard, an Indonesian paradise that feels like a fantasy. Soak up the sun on a stretch of fine white sand, or commune with the tropical creatures as you dive along coral ridges or the colorful wreck of a WWII war ship.</dd>
